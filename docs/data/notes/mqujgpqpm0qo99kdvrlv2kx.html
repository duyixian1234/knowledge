<blockquote>
<p>The DRY principle stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself” and was first introduced to the masses by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in the book The Pragmatic Programmer, their definition of the DRY principle is as follows:</p>
<p>“Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. The alternative is to have the same thing expressed in two or more places. If you change one, you have to remember to change the others”</p>
