## 介绍

[FastAPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/)是一个新兴的 Python Web 框架。

> FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
>
> The key features are:
>
> - **Fast** : Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/#performance).
> - **Fast to code** : Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. \*
> - **Fewer bugs** : Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. \*
> - **Intuitive** : Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
> - **Easy** : Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
> - **Short** : Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
> - **Robust** : Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
> - **Standards-based** : Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (previously known as Swagger) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
