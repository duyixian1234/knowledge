## 介绍

[numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)是一个 Python 数值计算库，用于高效处理多维数组数据。

> Project description
>
> It provides:
>
> - a powerful N-dimensional array object
> - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
> - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
> - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
> - and much more
>
> Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
>
> All NumPy wheels distributed on PyPI are BSD licensed.
>
> NumPy requires pytest and hypothesis. Tests can then be run after installation with:
>
> ```
> python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'
> ```
