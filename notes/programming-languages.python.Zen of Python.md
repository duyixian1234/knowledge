## Python 之禅

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
>
> Explicit is better than implicit.
>
> Simple is better than complex.
>
> Complex is better than complicated.
>
> Flat is better than nested.
>
> Sparse is better than dense.
>
> Readability counts.
>
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
>
> Although practicality beats purity.
>
> Errors should never pass silently.
>
> Unless explicitly silenced.
>
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
>
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
>
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
>
> Now is better than never.
>
> Although never is often better than _right_ now.
>
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
>
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
>
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
